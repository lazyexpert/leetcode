# 110. Balanced Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Contraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4

## Example
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```
