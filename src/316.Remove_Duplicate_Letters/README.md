# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters
Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

## Example
```
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```

```
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```
